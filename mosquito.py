"""
This mosquitoes model accords to [Ross A, Killeen G, Smith T (2006) Relationships between host infectivity to
mosquitoes and asexual parasite density in. Am J Trop Med Hyg 75: 32â€“37.]

The model from Ross maps the infectivity to the density of asexual parasites. Gametocytes (erythrocytic sexual
parasite) stage is implicitly presented. So, an additional asexual parasites development curve is required .
